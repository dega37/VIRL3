Topology description
--------------------
4 IOS XRv, 8 IOSv routers

This is a 12-node topology that demonstrates a number of configuration aspects. 

The topology contains parallel links between many nodes but is focused on BGP configuration with Route-reflection and Hierarchical route-reflection being used. 

The IOSv-1 and IOSv-2s are set as Route-reflectors with IOSv-1 serving the RR cluster one, IOSv-2 serving RR cluster four.  The IOSv-3 and IOSv-4 instances are also set as Route-reflectors, IOSv-3 serving RR cluster one, IOSv-4 serving RR cluster 4. 

IOS XRv nodes are set as route-reflector clients but are also route-reflectors themselves, serving the down-steam IOSv routers.
